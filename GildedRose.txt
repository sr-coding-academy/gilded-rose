GILDED ROSE

_Description
Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison.
We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date.

_Items
“Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
“Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert

_Item Facts
All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
The Quality of an item is never negative
The Quality of an item is never more than 50
